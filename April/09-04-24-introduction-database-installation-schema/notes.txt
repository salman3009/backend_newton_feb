What is Database?
//It is an information store permanentely inside the hard disk.
//All over data is store here 
//It play very important role for entire application.
//Backend will fetchdata from database used for authentication , authorization etc.

Database is divided into two approached 
1.SQL  - structured query language
//Storing data in the form of table rows and columns
//RDMS - Relational Database (There will be relations between rows and columns) 
//predefined schema 
//vertically scalable
//ACID (Atomicity,Consistency,Isolation,Durability)
Example:MySQL,Oracle,PostgreSQL

2.NOSQL - No-structure query language 
//Storing data in the form of document-oriented,key-value with no structure.
//Non-relational and distributed database 
//No schema - Dynamic schema 
//horizontal scalable 
//Nosql is similar to json format
//CAP(Consistency,Availability,partition tolerance)
Example:Mongodb,GraphQL,HBase



Atomicity - each transaction inside table should get completed otherwise entire process data should be rollback.
Consistency - all table will have Consistency data.
Isolation - multiple transaction will happen concurrently but separately.
Durability - data will be Availabile event it is software or hardware failure.
partition tolerance - Data easily we can able to divide into multiple machine.
