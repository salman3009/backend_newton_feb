How Nodejs Works:
1.Event loop 
//manages all the asynchronous operations 
//new events in the event queue 

2.Event Queue 
//Hold various types of request timers,I/o events.

3.callback 

4.Single thread 
//process in execution 

5.thread pool 
//blocking operation separate thread will be given from thread pool 

6.CPU Bound operations(os,file system)
//cpu bound operation are blocking operation 

7.sync(blocking) and async(non-blocking) operations 
===================================================
Nodejs Event Driven Programming: 
//A callback function is called when an event is triggered.
//An event loop that listens for event triggers and calls the corresponding event handler for that events
//these 'events' can be access via the 'events module.
============================================
API:Application Programming interface
//It is set of commands, functions or protocols that act as intermediary that enables 
two applications to communicate.


REST:Representation State Transfer 
//it means the transfer of the state via http 
//format such as json,html,xml,plain text 
//REST will work only on http protocol 
//http methods, GET,POST PATCH 

REST API
=====================================
How Nodejs working?
//Nodejs is working on single thread 
//Any incoming requests first will go inside the event queue 
//Event loop will take one be one request from event queue 
//Event loop will process non blocking operation and send back the result 
//Event loop for blocking operation separate thread will be created from the thread pool
